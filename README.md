### Session 1: 

**Topic: SDLC (System Development Life Cycle)**

SDLC, or System Development Life Cycle, is a process that includes the following stages:

1. **Planning**
2. **Creating**
3. **Testing**
4. **Deploying**

This process leads to the deployment of software in an organization and is referred to as the Application Development Life Cycle.

In software engineering, this cycle that transforms software to hardware is known as SDLC.

To implement SDLC, a series of frameworks are used, all of which consist of 9 stages:

1. **Analysis**
2. **Planning**
3. **Design**
4. **Development**
5. **Testing**
6. **Deployment**
7. **Maintenance**
8. **Evaluation**
9. **Disposal**

### Note:
The goal of SDLC is to produce high-quality software that can meet customer needs as quickly as possible.

### Six Popular Frameworks:
1. Agile
2. Lean
3. Waterfall
4. Iterative
5. Spiral
6. DevOps

### Three Essential Frameworks for SDLC:
1. Agile
2. Waterfall
3. DevOps

#### Waterfall Model:

In this model, no stage is performed in parallel; each stage must be completed before moving on to the next. There is no way to go back to a previous stage unless the entire process is completed.

**Why is it less used?**
If changes are needed after the initial design, the entire process must be restarted from the beginning, making it inefficient.

#### Agile Model:

**Notes:**
- Agile is used for project management.
- Agile incorporates base practices from other models into its framework.
- Agile is used not only for technical projects but also for non-technical projects, such as customer service and human resource management.
- The most important concept in Agile is "fast failure," which breaks down the project into smaller parts to quickly identify and address issues.

**Note:**
Agile helps development teams fix small issues before they become big problems. It encourages frequent feedback to solve issues collaboratively. This method requires a Scrum Master to coordinate and connect the teams.

**Scrum:**
Scrum is one of the most well-known Agile frameworks and is used to synchronize teams.

**Responsibilities of a Scrum Master:**
1. Define time scopes for teams
2. Define Sprints for each stage
3. Conduct Scrum Meetings

**Problems with Scrum:**
When the number of teams increases, Scrum becomes less effective. It struggles to manage a large number of projects or incoming tickets, especially in large organizations.

#### DevOps Model:

**DevOps Perspective:**
DevOps aims to automate the interaction and communication between development and operations teams as much as possible to satisfy the customer.

**DevOps Model:**
- Adopts the culture of Agile for planning and teamwork, but recognizes it is not sufficient alone.
- Shifts interactions from a business level to a technical level between development and operations teams.
- Automates many processes in software production.

**Responsibilities in DevOps:**
1. Automate the build and test process
2. Place released versions in a repository
3. Automate delivery and deployment processes
4. Monitor and revert to a previous version if an issue arises in the production environment

**Need for DevOps Engineers:**
Collaboration between development and operations teams requires DevOps Engineers who possess both broad and deep skills in both areas.
